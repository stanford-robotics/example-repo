### This is an example README.md page for any robotics club project

This is an empty github repository that can be used as a template for other projects. 

The Stanford Robotics Club is home to a wide variety of robotics and mechatronics projects, and offers funding for any excited student that can present a plan and demonstrated interest for a team robotics project. The groupâ€™s current flagship project is a Mars rover for the University Rover Competition, a competition held annually in the Utah desert. The group has over a hundred registered members and approximately 50 active members. SRC has been building out of labs in the Packard building since its creation. The club is now the principal user of Lab 064, a new makerspace in the Packard building basement converted from previously underused lab space. It features a wide variety of primarily electrical and mechanical equipment to start basic engineering projects. If you've read this far then maybe you should just go ahead and start your own project.
